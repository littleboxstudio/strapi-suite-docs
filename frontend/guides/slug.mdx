The slug system links your website URLs to your content in Strapi. When you visit a page, the framework uses the slug to find the right data and show the correct template.

## How It Works

The slug matches the path you see in the browser. For example, if you go to `domain.com/about`, the slug is `about`. The framework takes this slug and asks Littlebox Strapi Suite for the page details.

<Note>
  Check the [backend documentation](/backend/guides/slug) to learn how to create and manage slugs in the admin panel.

### Dynamic Routing

The file `src/app/(pages)/[...slug]/page.tsx` handles these requests. It acts as the main entry point for your dynamic pages. Here is what it does:

1.  **Gets the Slug**: It reads the slug from the URL.
2.  **Gets Data**: It fetches the page content from Strapi using the `getPage` function.
3.  **Shows the Page**: It loads and displays the template that matches with [page attributes](/frontend/guides/attributes#template).

## Templates

The `template` field in Littlebox Strapi Suite tells the framework how to display the page. The system looks for a matching folder in `src/app/templates`.

For a template named `home`, the system loads:

- **Logic**: `src/app/templates/home/content.ts` runs a strategy function. You use this to handle data before the page loads.
- **View**: The default export (often `index.tsx`) inside the folder shows the visual part of the page.

<Warning>
  Ensure the template name in Strapi matches the folder name in `src/app/templates`. If they do not match, the page
  handles the error gracefully but may not show what you expect.
</Warning>

## SEO and Metadata

The framework handles SEO for you automatically. It uses `generateMetadata` to fetch the page data and create the necessary HTML tags.

It also adds structured data (JSON-LD) to help search engines understand your site:

- **Breadcrumbs**: Shows the path to the current page.
- **Base JSON-LD**: details about the page structure.

## Data Fetching

The `getPage` function handles the connection to the API. It uses a cache to make your site faster.

```typescript
const getPage = cache(async (slug: string) => {
  const page = await fetch(
    `${process.env.API_BASE_URL}/api/littlebox-strapi-suite/modules/pages?slug=${slug}&properties=attributes`,
    headers,
  );
  return page.json();
});
```

If the system cannot find a page for the slug, it shows a 404 "Not Found" page.
