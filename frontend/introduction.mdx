Littlebox Strapi Suite Frontend is a lightweight framework built on top of Next.js. It simplifies the integration with Strapi and reduces repetitive tasks, 
helping save time and focus on delivering a great user experience. Let the technical complexities stay behind the scenes so you can focus on what really matters.

The developer has full access to the source code and can make changes as needed, although in most cases, this shouldn't be necessary. 
Visit the [Essentials](/frontend/guides/essentials) section to understand the structure before making any changes.

Use the frontend together with the Littlebox Strapi Suite Plugin. Visit the [What is Littlebox Strapi Suite?](/before-starting) section to learn more about the pluginâ€™s purpose.
