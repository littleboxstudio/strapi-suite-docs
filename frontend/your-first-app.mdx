Before starting the tutorial, make sure to follow these steps:

2. Littlebox Strapi Suite Frontend: have the frontend installed and configured as described in the [frontend documentation](/frontend/installation).

## Tutorial
### Introduction
In this tutorial, you build your own app integrated with Strapi.
This is a great way to experience a typical development workflow while learning key concepts, tools, and terminology 
used when building apps with Next.js and Strapi.

Strapi lets you build different data structures based on your project’s needs. For demonstration purposes, 
you’ll create a collection type called `Pages`, where fields like `title`, `slug`, and `seo` are shared across all documents 
in that collection. Each section within a page will be a component that you can add or remove depending on the specific 
content of each page. 

You can also create each page as a single type, depending on how you want to organize your data. 
However, for this tutorial and better understanding, we recommend following our approach. 

Any document can be treated as a page, as long as it includes the following specifications:
- The fields `title`, `slug`, and `seo` properly configured.
- The template where the document data will be injected.

### 1. Set up the homepage
Access the Strapi admin panel at `http://localhost:1337` (this may vary depending on your local setup). Go to the `Content-Type Builder` 
and create a new collection called `Pages` as shown in the image below.

In the `Advanced Settings` tab, also enable `Internationalization`, we’ll cover this topic in more detail later.
