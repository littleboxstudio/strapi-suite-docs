## What is Littlebox Strapi Suite?
The Littlebox Strapi Suite is a plugin designed to enhance Strapi for building and managing institutional websites and blogs. It introduces features such as menu creation, string translations, parameter management, templates, page attributes, and content search via slugs. These additions improve SEO by enabling user-friendly URLs without complex implementation, simplifying site organization and maintenance. When combined with the [Littlebox Strapi Frontend](/frontend/introduction), it becomes a powerful tool that saves development time, simplifies complex tasks, and automates repetitive ones, allowing you to focus on delivering an optimal user experience.
