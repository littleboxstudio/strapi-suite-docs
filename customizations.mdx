## Open Source and Full Control

Littlebox is 100% open source. You have full access to the code. The frontend works like a mini-framework to help you integrate faster, but it does not limit you. You do not install it as a package. Instead, you clone the repository. This gives you the freedom to modify anything you need.

You own the code. Feel free to change any part of it to match your project's goals. If you have an idea to improve the platform, or if you make a change that could help others, please let us know. We welcome your suggestions and contributions. Visit our [Contributing](/contributing) page to see how you can help.
