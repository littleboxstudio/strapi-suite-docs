Any document can be treated as a page once a slug is assigned.
This makes it possible to define properties that support frontend integration, such as setting a parent document and 
inheriting its [slug](/backend/guides/slug) to create a hierarchical URL.

### Parent
It’s useful when defining a page hierarchy, where the child automatically inherits the parent’s slug. This creates a clean, SEO-friendly URL.

For example, in an application with a news listing page at `/news`, clicking on a news item opens a detail page with a URL based on the parent page.
In this case, the URL combines the parent slug `/news` with the news title, such as "Littlebox Suite helped me build websites faster", resulting in a final URL like `/news/littlebox-suite-helped-me-build-websites-faster`.

**Step 1**: Access the Strapi admin panel.\
**Step 2**: Go to the "Content-Type Builder".\
**Step 3**: Create a new single type called `news`.\
**Step 4**: Add the [slug](/backend/guides/slug) custom field and title field.\
**Step 5**: Create a new collection type called `news`.\
**Step 6**: Add the custom [slug](/backend/guides/slug) field and title field.\
**Step 7**: Go to the "Content Manager".\
**Step 8**: Create a new entry in the single type with the title "News".

/>

**Step 9**: Create a new entry in the collection type with the title "Littlebox Suite helped me build websites faster".\
**Step 10**: In the left panel, under the Page Attributes section, set the parent to News.
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="https://statics.littlebox.pt/strapi-suite/backend-page-attributes-step-2.png"
/>

The document automatically inherits the parent’s slug and updates it whenever the parent’s slug changes.
This hierarchy can extend to three, four, or as many levels as needed. Simply select a parent for each document, as long as that parent also has its own parent.
