## Requirements

The full installation requirements are identical to those of Strapi and can be found in the [Strapi Quick Start guide](https://docs.strapi.io/cms/quick-start).

- Supported Strapi versions: 5.0.0 or later.

## Installation


### Install Strapi Suite
Install the Littlebox Strapi Suite plugin in your Strapi project.
<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @littlebox/strapi-suite --save
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @littlebox/strapi-suite
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Strapi SEO
The Littlebox Strapi Suite plugin requires Strapi’s official SEO plugin. Read the plugin [installation guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strapi/plugin-seo) to install and configure it correctly.

### Add required fields
Add some extra fields for the Littlebox Strapi Suite plugin to work correctly.
Read below to see which fields are mandatory.

#### Slug and title
You can access any document, whether it's part of a collection or a single type, through the API using its slug.
The Littlebox Suite plugin adds slug-based search functionality, which is especially useful for building dynamic websites like blogs.
Every document you want to expose to the frontend through the API must include the custom field `Littlebox Slug`, along with the `Title` field.
Read more about [how the slug works](/backend/guides/slug).

#### Robots
Robots meta tags play an important role in technical SEO. They give you precise control over how search engines handle each page on your site.
However, these fields are only required when you use the [frontend](/frontend/introduction).

To make the plugin work correctly, create the following custom fields:
- `index` tells search engines to include the page in their index so it appears in search results.
- `follow` tells bots to follow the links on the page and pass link authority ("link juice"). This is also the default behavior.
- `nocache` asks Google and other search engines not to store a cached version of the page.
- `noimageindex` useful when you don’t want images from the page to appear in image search results, while still allowing the rest of the page to be indexed and crawled.

Follow these steps to create the fields. Make sure you [install the official Strapi SEO plugin](/backend/installation#install-strapi-seo) first.

**Step 1**: Access the Strapi admin panel.\
**Step 2**: Go to the "Content-Type Builder".\
**Step 3**: In the list of components, click on "seo".\
**Step 4**: Click "Add another field to this component".\
**Step 5**: Select the "Component" field.\
**Step 6**: Add the following settings:
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}

/>
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="https://statics.littlebox.pt/strapi-suite/robots-add-component-step-2.png"
/>
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="https://statics.littlebox.pt/strapi-suite/robots-add-component-step-3.png"
/>
**Step 7**: A new component called "robots" appears in the field list.
Click "Add another field to this component", which appears right below it.
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="https://statics.littlebox.pt/strapi-suite/robots-add-component-step-4.png"
/>
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="https://statics.littlebox.pt/strapi-suite/robots-add-component-step-5.png"
/>

**Step 8**: Repeat `step 7` for the fields "follow", "nocache", and "noimageindex".
